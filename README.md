# CovidPandasStats

This is the Pandas Version of a final project. Project ongoing.

The overall goal of this project is to get relevant information of cases and/or deaths in individual states within the US. There are different functions that examine events between dates, total of new cases for specified dates, events per capita, etc.
This version is designed to minimize lines of code and present data in a cleaner way.

When the program is run as is, it creates individual DataFrames for the states with the day-to-day changes in case numbers.

To get the latest case numbers you can pull the 'us-states.csv' from the NYTimes github.


*The project had to use data provided by the [NYTimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
